# ALON-Virtual-Assistant

I have created my own version of a virtual assistant, similar to Appleâ€™s Siri, Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Our program is named Alon which is written in the programming language Python. This program is capable of computing basic arithmetic, telling time, setting alarms and timers, communicating the weather, telling news feeds, drawing information from wikipedia, telling jokes, and sending text messages through WhatsApp.
